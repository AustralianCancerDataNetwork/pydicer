    "•\tPurpose: This function scans the specified directory and reads each DICOM file, organizing them by their modality (CT, RTDOSE, RTPLAN, RTSTRUCT). \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDictionary Initialization: The dictionary dicoms is used to categorize the files based on the Modality attribute, which is standard across DICOM files. It initializes a dictionary with keys corresponding to the different DICOM modalities we expect to handle: CT, RTDOSE, RTPLAN, and RTSTRUCT. Each key maps to an empty list intended to store DICOM files of that modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSpecific Handling for RTDOSE: While all modalities are processed uniformly by storing the files in the appropriate lists, additional processing is done for RTDOSE files. If the file has a pixel_array attribute (which contains the dose data), the function prints the maximum value found in this array. This step is particularly useful for quickly assessing the dose values directly from the DICOM files without needing further processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tError Handling: Includes a try-except block to catch and report errors that occur during the reading of DICOM files. This could be due to corrupt files, incorrect file formats, or other issues preventing a file from being read as a DICOM file."

    "### Function to Verify Linkages\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: This function checks and verifies the relationships between RTPLAN and RTSTRUCT, and then RTDOSE and RTPLAN based on UIDs to ensure that each RTDOSE is linked to the correct plan and structure set. It also checks the uniqueness of RTPLAN and RTDOSE individually before allowing the individual dose grids to be added. We have divided this function in separate components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: RTPLAN Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tUniqueness check of RTPLAN using composite key: It uses a combination of PlanName, NumberOfFractionsPlanned, and TreatmentMachineName to create a unique identifier for each RTPLAN. It uses a set to track which composite keys have been seen, ensuring each plan is processed only if it’s unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLinking with RTSTRUCT: If the RTPLAN is either unique or a duplicate but still needs processing for linking, the function checks if it has a ReferencedStructureSetSequence linking it to an RTSTRUCT. This link (corresponding plain_uid) is then stored in the stored_plans dictionary, mapping RTPLAN UIDs to RTSTRUCT UIDs, allowing for future reference when processing RTDOSE files.\n",
    "\n",
    "RTDOSE Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tUniqueness Check: Each RTDOSE file is checked for a pixel_array, ensuring it's a valid dose file and then is checked for uniqueness based on its dose grid. The function compares the current dose grid with previously stored dose grids in existing_dose_grids. If an identical grid is found, the RTDOSE is flagged as not unique; otherwise, it's added to the list of stored grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tVisualization of Differences: For each comparison, whether the grid is unique or not, the differences between dose grids are visualized. This helps in visually confirming the results of the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLinkage Check: If the RTDOSE grid is unique, the function then checks if this RTDOSE has a ReferencedRTPlanSequence. If it does, the function verifies that the referenced RTPLAN UID is stored in stored_plans. This confirms that the RTDOSE is correctly linked to an RTPLAN (and indirectly to an RTSTRUCT, assuming the RTPLAN-RTSTRUCT link was correctly established).\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIf all checks are passed (unique dose grid and correct linkage to RTPLAN and RTSTRUCT), the RTDOSE is considered valid and added to valid_doses. This dictionary collects all RTDOSE files that are correctly linked and unique, ready for further processing or analysis."
