    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AustralianCancerDataNetwork/pydicer/blob/main/examples/DatasetPreparation.ipynb)\n",

    "When working with real-world DICOM datasets, you will often need to tackle the task of cleaning the\n",
    "dataset. Often you will have several image series, structure set and even dose grids for each\n",
    "patient. However you typically want to select one relevant DICOM object in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help solve this, PyDicer provides a `dataset preparation` module which can be used to extract\n",
    "a subset of data from your overall set. Two example use cases where this might be useful are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysing dose to structures for a radiotherapy treatment**\n",
    "You will want to extract the dose grid which was calculated from the plan used to treat the\n",
    "patient, as well as the linked structure set and planning CT image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validating an Auto-segmentation tool**\n",
    "A structure set may have been prepared for the purposes of validation and saved off with a specific\n",
    "`SeriesDescription`. You select the latest structure set with that description as well as the\n",
    "linked image series to perform the auto-segmentation validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see in the examples below, you can provide your own logic to extract subsets of data\n",
    "using PyDicer."
